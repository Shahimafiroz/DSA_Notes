# Introduction and concepts

A **hash table**, also known as a **hash map**, is a **data structure** that enables **efficient** storage and retrieval of data through a **hash function**. It organizes data in **key-value pairs**, where each **key** is **unique** and associated with a corresponding **value**.

1. **Key-Value Storage**: Hash tables store data as <mark>unique key-value pairs</mark> for efficient retrieval.
    
2. **Hash Function:** A hash function <mark>maps keys to array indices</mark> for storage and retrieval.
    
3. **Fast Retrieval:** Hash tables <mark>quickly retrieve values based on keys </mark> (O(1) average time complexity).
    
4. **Unique Keys**: Hash tables require <mark>keys to be unique</mark> to ensure proper functioning. If two keys are the same, the value associated with the <mark>latest key will overwrite the previous value.</mark>
    
5. **Collision Handling:** Collisions, when <mark>two keys map to the same index,</mark> are handled using techniques like chaining or open addressing.
    
6. **Efficiency Trade-Off:** Hash tables balance memory usage and retrieval speed based on the <mark>array size and collision resolution strategy.</mark>
    
7. **Unordered Structure:** Hash tables do not guarantee a <mark>specific order for stored keys </mark> or values.
    
8. **Dynamic Resizing:** Hash tables can <mark>dynamically resize</mark> to accommodate changes in the number of elements.
    
9. **Memory Overhead:** Hash tables require additional memory <mark>for indices and collision resolution structures.</mark>
    

> **Question:** "But you might be wondering, this hash function, doesn't it slow things down?"

**Answer:** You might have the concern that the **hash function**, which is somewhat like a black box, could potentially slow down the operations. However, the design of hash tables considers this to ensure optimal performance.

Underneath the hood, hash tables utilize **optimized hashing functions** that are specifically designed to be **fast**. These functions are implemented within various programming languages and frameworks, ensuring efficient execution.

It is worth noting that there are certain hash functions, such as **SHA-256,** which are **intentionally slower**. However, such complex hash functions are commonly used in specialized areas like **cryptography,** where the objective is to deliberately increase the time required for hashing.

In the context of hash tables, the chosen hash function is typically one that provides fast execution. The time complexity of hash table operations is commonly assumed to be **O(1)**, denoting constant time complexity and ensuring rapid performance.

Hence, **although the inner workings of the hash function might seem like a mysterious black box, the implementation of optimized and fast hash functions allows hash tables to deliver efficient and speedy operations.**

# Hash Operations

| Operation | Time Complexity |
| --- | --- |
| Insertion | O(1) |
| Deletion | O(1) |
| Retrieval | O(1) |
| Update | O(1) |
| Resizing | O(n) |
| Collision Resolution | Varies (typically O(1) with a good hash function and load factor) |
