### PROCEDURAL

Procedures or routines are the fundamental building blocks of procedural programming. Procedures are made up of sequence instructions that indicate a computing step to be performed when the programme is run.

EXAMPLES :- Python, Dart, Swift.

### FUNCTIONAL

Functional programming is a programming modelÂ in which everything is bound using pure mathematical functions style. It's a declarative programming approach.

EXAMPLES:- C++, Python , Java , C# , Swift.

### OBJECT ORIENTED

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming model that uses classes and objects. It's utilised to break down a software programme into reusable code blueprints (called classes) that may be used to build specific instances of objects.


EXAMPLES :- Python, Dart, JavaScript, TypeScript, Dart, Java.
