  OBJECTS AND CLASS

CLASS
A class is a template or archetype that is defined by the user and used to build things. It denotes the collection of attributes or methods that all objects of the same type share.

OBJECT
It represents real-life entities and is a fundamental unit of Object-Oriented Programming. A typical Java application produces a large number of objects, which interact via executing methods.

So you can say that object is an instance of class

*Note- the by default value of properties of class will be 
int rolno = 0
float marks = 0.0
String name = null

now I want you to consider the 1st Image. When executing the compiler goes to class "Student" as per our code then it tries to find object "shahima" then the value of property rolno, marks, name respectively is found, if it exists then its printed. But if the value of the object is not assigned then it prints the default value of the properties in the class . For example for khushi we have not assigned any value to the various attributes of the class "Student" and hence the compiler will go back and print the default values of the properties of the class.  

here is a program to create an object "shahima" of class "Student"

```
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Student shahima = new Student();
        Student khushi = new Student();

        shahima.rolno = 13;
        shahima.marks = 100 ;
        shahima.name = "Shahima Khan";
        System.out.println("Shahima's data\n");
        System.out.println(shahima.marks);
        System.out.println(shahima.rolno);
        System.out.println(shahima.name );

        System.out.println("\nkhushi's data\n");

        System.out.println(khushi.marks);
        System.out.println(khushi.rolno);
        System.out.println(khushi.name);
    }

}

class Student{
    int rolno;
    float marks;
    String name;
}


```



here is the output of our program and its exactly how we expected it to be.
